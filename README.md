Project Description:

Waggle, a startup specializing in smart pet devices, has seen great success with its Lapdog device—a fitness collar that tracks dogs’ steps, reminds owners when it's time for a walk, and even repels fleas. With fantastic reviews, growing sales, and proven effectiveness, the product has been a hit.

Building on this momentum, the product team distributed 1,000 Lapcat prototypes for field testing. After months of data collection, we are tasked with creating a boardroom-ready Power BI report that compares the results from the Lapcat prototypes with the data collected from Lapdog devices. The goal is to help the CEO decide whether the Lapcat device is the next big opportunity or an expensive misstep.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CEO’s Key Questions:

Did the average daily steps for cats using the device increase, similar to the trend seen with dogs?

Were Lapcat owners as satisfied with the product as Lapdog owners?


Additionally, the Chief Marketing Officer wants the report to align with Waggle’s brand, ensuring it uses the company’s approved color palette, logo, and icons.

While the product team trusts us to explore other relevant insights, their primary interest lies in comparing the data for dogs and cats using Waggle devices. They also want to better understand the families who own these pets. The report should include interactive slicers, allowing the CEO and other stakeholders to filter and explore the data at their discretion.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Report Requirements:

Slicers: The report should include at least five slicers per page, including:

A drop-down slicer

A slider slicer

A hierarchy slicer

A slicer with the "Select All" option enabled

A slicer with the search box feature enabled

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bookmark Features: The report must feature two bookmark functionalities:

One that allows users to swap a visual with a different one dynamically

Another that resets all filters on the page

Navigation Buttons: The report should contain navigation buttons that change in color or size when hovered over.

The report will consist of three tabs:

Tab 1: Focuses on the CEO’s key questions, comparing the average daily steps and user ratings between Lapdog and Lapcat devices.

Tab 2: Provides insights related to the pets using the devices, such as breed distribution, gender, and age data, with pet type as a distinguishing factor.

Tab 3: Focuses on the families that own the pets, including a table of family data, a card showing the total number of pets in the dataset, and a visualization of household income vs. number of pets owned, with pet type as a category.

The final report will be designed to offer clear, actionable insights while maintaining a professional, on-brand look that appeals to stakeholders.
